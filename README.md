# finger-count

I have successfully trained a CNN model to detect how many fingers I am holding up. 

The classification report can be seen below:

                  precision  recall   f1-score   support

           0       0.98      0.87      0.92       906
           1       0.82      0.93      0.87       906
           2       0.88      0.93      0.91       906
           3       0.92      0.80      0.86       906
           4       0.93      0.98      0.96       906

    accuracy                           0.90      4530
   macro avg       0.91      0.90      0.90      4530
weighted avg       0.91      0.90      0.90      4530

And then I compared it with Convex Hull algorithm.
